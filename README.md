# Check-Book-Buy

## ðŸ“„ Abstract
The demand of basic necessities prevails over their supply during such a time of a global pandemic. People have to get general daily items like food and medicine and sometimes the items might not be available in that particular shop and thereby risking themselves by staying out more and getting affected by the virus. I propose a platform to acquire and share data between two most significant parties in the supply chain that is the buyer and the seller. A web portal that will connect the shopkeepers and the customers. The seller needs to feed the stock data and the buyer his requirements on this portal. This data is then uploaded to the database from which a network is created between different buyers and sellers.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective 
To help the small shop owners with their business that they are financially better off and the citizens to get their required items during this lockdown period to the maximum possible extent along with reducing the risk of transmission of the virus and following and follow all the norms of social distancing which has taken a hit on their lives. We aim to allow people of a particular area buy daily grocery and essential items without disappointment and saving their time by directing them to the correct shop with the available items.

Be it a pandemic or just a regular day. This webapp will be useful in getting what the customers want and could possibly increase the business of the shop owners by making them widespread in the virtual world which is often overlooked. It would save customerâ€™s time and resources which otherwise they might have spent in a futile trip to their known general store. It would be beneficial to both the customer and the shopkeeper.
